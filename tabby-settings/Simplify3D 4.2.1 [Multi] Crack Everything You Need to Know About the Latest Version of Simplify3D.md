## How to Customize Your Print Settings Using the Variable Settings Wizard
 
One of the most powerful features of Simplify3D is the ability to customize any setting that you want for different regions of your model. This gives you the flexibility to adjust the print quality, strength, or appearance of your model according to your needs.
 
To use this feature, you need to use the Variable Settings Wizard, which can be accessed from the Edit menu or by clicking on the icon on the left toolbar. The wizard will guide you through the steps of creating different processes for your model, each with its own settings.
 
You can choose which settings you want to vary for each process, such as layer height, infill, temperature, speed, etc. You can also choose which regions of your model will use each process, either by selecting them manually or by using automatic tools such as splitting by height or angle.
 
Once you have created your processes, Simplify3D will automatically create a seamless transition between them, ensuring a smooth print without extra solid layers or Z-scars. You can preview and verify your processes using the interactive print preview, which we will discuss in the next section.
 
## How to Preview and Verify Your Processes Using the Interactive Print Preview
 
Simplify3D offers a unique interactive print preview that allows you to simulate your print exactly as it will happen on your 3D printer. You can watch the toolhead as it lays down each individual line of plastic, giving you an unprecedented level of insight into how your 3D printer will behave.
 
The interactive print preview has been updated in Simplify3D 4.2.1 [Multi] to include more information about which exact process was used to create different parts of your model. This makes it easy to verify that you have assigned the correct settings for each region of your model.
 
To access the interactive print preview, click on the Prepare to Print button on the left toolbar or press Ctrl+P on your keyboard. You can then use the slider at the bottom of the window to move through each layer of your print. You can also use the buttons on the right side of the window to control the view options, such as showing cross sections, coloring by speed or feature type, or hiding parts of your model.
 
If you have multiple processes for your model, you will see a colored legend at the top of the window that shows which process corresponds to which color. You can also hover over any part of your model to see which process was used for that section. This way, you can check that everything is as expected before sending your print to your 3D printer.
 
## How to Optimize Your Print Quality and Speed Using the New Options for Thin Walls and Gaps
 
Another important improvement in Simplify3D 4.2.1 [Multi] is the new options for thin walls and gaps. These are common challenges in 3D printing that can affect both the quality and speed of your prints.
