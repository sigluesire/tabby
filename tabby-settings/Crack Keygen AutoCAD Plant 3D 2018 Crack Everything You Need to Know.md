- Collaborate securely in a cloud-based common data environment
- Speed up and automate P&ID drafting and 3D modeling with in-context commands
- Automatically create piping isometric drawings directly from the 3D model
- Use industry-standard symbol libraries and data validation tools

In this article, we will show you how to get started with AutoCAD Plant 3D 2018 and some of its key features.
 
## Creating a Project
 
The first step to use AutoCAD Plant 3D 2018 is to create a project. A project contains all the files and settings related to your plant design, such as P&IDs, 3D models, drawings, reports, and catalogs. To create a project, follow these steps:

1. On the ribbon, click Home tab > Project panel > New Project.
2. In the Create Project dialog box, enter a name and a description for your project.
3. Select a project template from the list or browse to an existing project folder to copy its settings.
4. Click OK.

A new project folder will be created in the specified location and opened in AutoCAD Plant 3D 2018.
 
## Creating a P&ID
 
A P&ID (piping and instrumentation diagram) is a schematic representation of the process flow and equipment of a plant. It shows the piping, valves, instruments, tags, and annotations of a plant system. To create a P&ID, follow these steps:

1. On the ribbon, click Home tab > Project panel > New P&ID Drawing.
2. In the Create P&ID Drawing dialog box, enter a name for your drawing and click OK.
3. A new drawing will be created with a default P&ID template.
4. On the ribbon, click Schematic tab > Insert Components panel to access the tool palettes that contain the P&ID symbols.
5. Drag and drop the symbols from the tool palettes to the drawing area. You can use in-context commands to snap, rotate, flip, or align the symbols as you place them.
6. To connect the symbols with pipes or signal lines, use the Line tool on the Schematic tab > Insert Components panel.
7. To add tags or annotations to the symbols, use the Tag or Annotation tools on the Schematic tab > Modify panel.
8. To edit the properties of the symbols or lines, use the Properties palette on the right side of the screen.
9. To check for data consistency and errors in your P&ID, use the Validate tool on the Schematic tab > Tools panel.

You can save your P&ID drawing as a DWG file in your project folder.
 
## Creating a 3D Model
 
A 3D model is a realistic representation of the physical structure and layout of your plant. It shows the piping, equipment, supports, structures, and other components of your plant system. To create a 3D model, follow these steps:

1. On the ribbon, click Home tab > Project panel > New 3D Model Drawing.
2. In the Create 3D Model Drawing dialog box, enter a name for your drawing and click OK.
3. A new drawing will be created with a default 3D model template.
4. On the ribbon, click Home tab > Model panel to access the tool palettes that contain the 3D model components.
5. Drag and drop the components from the tool palettes to the drawing area. You can use in-context commands to snap, rotate, move, or align the components as you place them.
6. To connect the components with pipes or duct 8cf37b1e13
