## Exploring SQL Prompt 5 Features
 
SQL Prompt 5 offers many features that can enhance your productivity and code quality when working with SQL. Here are some of the features you can explore:
 
### Partial Match Suggestions
 
SQL Prompt 5 can suggest object names based on CamelCase or mid-string matches. For example, if you type mt, the object MyTable is suggested. This is especially useful if you can only remember part of an object name. You can also use wildcards (\*) to match any characters in an object name.
 
### Tabs Instead of Spaces
 
SQL Prompt 5 allows you to choose whether to use tabs or spaces for indentation when formatting your code. You can set this preference from the SQL Prompt options. Using tabs instead of spaces can save space and make your code more consistent.
 
### Query Tab Coloring
 
If you are using SQL Server Management Studio 2012, you can use SQL Prompt 5 to color your query tabs by server connection. This can help you avoid confusion and mistakes when working with multiple servers. You can assign a color category to a server from the Object Explorer and SQL Prompt 5 will automatically color the query tabs connected to that server.
 
### Data Explorer
 
SQL Prompt 5 provides a data explorer that gives you an overview of the data in your database. You can use it to filter and sort the data in tables and views, view the creation script and column summary for an object, and generate a SELECT \* FROM query for a table or view. You can access the data explorer from the SQL Prompt menu.
 
### SQL Tab Magic
 
SQL Tab Magic is an add-in for SSMS that enhances your tab management. You can use it to view a list of recently closed or open tabs, search your open tabs by title or content, and re-open tabs on startup. You can also preview the contents of a tab before switching to it. You can install SQL Tab Magic from the SQL Prompt Labs options.
