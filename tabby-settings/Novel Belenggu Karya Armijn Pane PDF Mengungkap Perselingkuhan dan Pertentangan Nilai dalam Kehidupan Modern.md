## The Plot
 
The novel consists of 24 chapters and is divided into three parts. The first part introduces the main characters and their problems. Sukartono is a successful doctor who is married to Sumartini, a beautiful and intelligent woman. However, they are not happy with their marriage, as they have different personalities and interests. Sukartono is a rational and disciplined man who is devoted to his work and his patients. He is also a nationalist who supports the independence movement of Indonesia. Sumartini is an emotional and artistic woman who feels neglected and bored by her husband. She is also a feminist who wants to have more freedom and autonomy in her life.
 
They both have extramarital affairs with other people. Sukartono rekindles his relationship with Rohayah, his childhood friend who is now a widow living in Jakarta. Rohayah is a gentle and loyal woman who loves Sukartono unconditionally. She also shares his nationalist ideals and supports his career. Sumartini resumes her romance with Tono, her former lover who is now a journalist and a poet. Tono is a passionate and adventurous man who admires Sumartini's beauty and intelligence. He also encourages her to pursue her artistic talents and to express her opinions.
 
The second part depicts the climax of the novel, when the affairs are exposed and the conflicts escalate. Sumartini discovers that Sukartono has been seeing Rohayah and confronts him angrily. She also reveals that she has been seeing Tono and demands a divorce. Sukartono refuses to divorce her and accuses her of being unfaithful and immoral. He also threatens to kill Tono if he ever sees him again. Sumartini leaves the house and goes to Tono's place.
 
Sukartono follows her and finds Tono there. He attacks Tono with a knife, but Tono manages to escape. Sukartono then chases him to the street, where he is hit by a car and dies. Sumartini witnesses the scene and faints. She is taken to the hospital by Tono, where she meets Rohayah, who has come to visit Sukartono. Rohayah tells Sumartini that she is pregnant with Sukartono's child and asks for her forgiveness. Sumartini feels sorry for Rohayah and realizes that she has been selfish and cruel.
 
The third part shows the aftermath of the tragedy and the resolution of the novel. Sumartini decides to end her relationship with Tono and to take care of Rohayah and her child. She also reconciles with her parents, who have disapproved of her marriage and her affair. She realizes that she has been wrong in rejecting her husband and her family, and that she needs to find peace within herself. She also decides to pursue her education and her career as a teacher.
 
Tono accepts Sumartini's decision and respects her choice. He also decides to leave Jakarta and to travel around Indonesia as a journalist and a poet. He hopes to find inspiration and happiness in his work and in his country.
 
Rohayah gives birth to a son, whom she names Sukarno, after Sukartono's real name. She raises him with Sumartini's help and love. She also continues to support the nationalist movement of Indonesia, hoping that her son will grow up in a free and prosperous nation.
