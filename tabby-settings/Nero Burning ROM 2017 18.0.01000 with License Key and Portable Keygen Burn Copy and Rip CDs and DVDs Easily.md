To start creating your website, launch TemplateToaster and select the platform you want to use for your website. For example, if you want to create a WordPress website, select WordPress from the menu.
 
Then, you will see a blank canvas where you can design your website. You can use the toolbar on the top to access various options and features. You can also use the sidebar on the right to customize different elements of your website, such as header, menu, content, footer, etc.
 
To create your website from scratch, you can drag and drop different blocks on the canvas and edit them as you like. You can also add images, text, buttons, icons, widgets, and more to your website. You can preview your website at any time by clicking on the preview button on the toolbar.

To upload your website, you will need a domain name and a web hosting service. You can use any web hosting service that supports your chosen platform. For example, if you created a WordPress website, you will need a web hosting service that supports WordPress.
