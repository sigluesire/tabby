Backgammon is one of the oldest and most popular board games in the world. It is a game of luck and strategy, where two players move their checkers around a board with 24 triangles, trying to bear them off before their opponent. Backgammon can be played online or offline, but if you want to enjoy it on your PC without spending any money, you can download it for free using a torrent client.

- The objective of the game is to move all your checkers into your home board and then bear them off before your opponent does.
- You move your checkers according to the numbers on the dice you roll. You can move one checker for each die or one checker for the total number of both dice, as long as the points you land on are open (not occupied by two or more of your opponent's checkers).
- If you roll a double (the same number on both dice), you can move four times, using the same number on each die.
- If you land on a point with only one of your opponent's checkers, you can hit it and send it to the bar. The bar is the middle ridge that divides the board. Your opponent must re-enter his checker from the bar to your home board before he can move any other checkers.
- You can block your opponent from re-entering by occupying six consecutive points in your home board. This is called making a prime.
- You can start bearing off your checkers once they are all in your home board. To bear off a checker, you need to roll a number that corresponds to the point where the checker is located. If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, you must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered point. If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, you can remove a checker from the highest point that has a checker.
- The first player to bear off all his checkers wins the game.

Backgammon is a game that can be played for fun or for stakes. If you play for stakes, you can use a doubling cube to increase the value of the game. The doubling cube is a six-sided die that has the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 on its faces. It indicates the current stake of the game.
 
At the start of the game, the doubling cube is placed in the middle of the board with the number 64 facing up. This means that the stake is one point. Either player can propose to double the stake before rolling his dice. The other player can either accept or decline. If he accepts, he takes the cube and places it on his side of the board with the number 2 facing up. This means that the stake is now two points. If he declines, he forfeits the game and loses one point.
 
The player who owns the cube can propose to double again before rolling his dice. The other player can accept or decline as before. The cube can be doubled up to 64 times, but this rarely happens in practice.
 
The winner of the game receives as many points as shown on the face of the cube. However, if he manages to bear off all his checkers before his opponent bears off any, he wins a gammon and receives twice as many points as shown on the cube. If he manages to bear off all his checkers while his opponent still has a checker on the bar or in his home board, he wins a backgammon and receives three times as many points as shown on the cube.
