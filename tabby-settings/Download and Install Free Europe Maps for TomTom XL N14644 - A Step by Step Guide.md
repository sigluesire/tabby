## Using TomTom MyDrive Connect
 
TomTom MyDrive Connect is a free software that allows you to manage your TomTom device updates and services on a Mac or PC.

To use TomTom MyDrive Connect, you need to sign in or create an account on the [TomTom website](https://www.tomtom.com/en_us/navigation/mydrive-connect/). Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Install MyDrive Connect on your computer. You can download it for Windows or Mac from the TomTom website.
2. Connect your TomTom XL N14644 device to your computer using the USB cable. MyDrive Connect will start automatically.
3. A new screen will open. Log in and choose the updates you would like to perform. You can select the Europe map from the list of available maps.
