But how can you get this pack for free? Well, there are a few ways to do that. Here are some of them:
 
- **Steam**: If you already own RPG Maker MV on Steam, you can get this pack for free by following these steps:
    1. Go to the Steam store page of RPG Maker MV - Time Fantasy: Monsters[^1^] [^2^].
    2. Click on the "Download" button and wait for the installation to finish.
    3. Launch RPG Maker MV and go to the DLC folder. You should see the Time Fantasy: Monsters folder there.
    4. Enjoy using the sprites in your projects.
- **Time Fantasy Website**: If you don't have RPG Maker MV on Steam, you can still get some of the sprites from this pack for free by visiting the Time Fantasy website[^3^]. This is the official website of Jason Perry, the creator of the Time Fantasy graphics. There, you can find some free resources that you can use for non-commercial purposes, such as:
    1. A four-frame animation of a dragon sprite.
    2. A sheet of 16x16 icons.
    3. A sheet of 32x32 icons.
    4. A sheet of 48x48 icons.
    5. A sheet of 64x64 icons.
    6. A sheet of 96x96 icons.
    7. A sheet of 128x128 icons.

To download these resources, just right-click on them and save them to your computer. You can also check out the blog posts on the website for more tips and tutorials on how to use the graphics.
- **Piracy**: Another way to get this pack for free is by pirating it from illegal websites or torrent sites. However, this is not recommended for several reasons:
    1. It is unethical and disrespectful to the creator who spent a lot of time and effort making these graphics.
    2. It is illegal and could get you in trouble with the law or your internet service provider.
    3. It is risky and could expose your computer to viruses, malware, or other harmful software.
    4. It is unreliable and could result in corrupted files, incomplete downloads, or poor quality graphics.

Therefore, it is better to avoid piracy and support the creator by purchasing the pack legally or using the free resources available on his website.

In conclusion, RPG Maker MV - Time Fantasy: Monsters is a great DLC pack for anyone who loves retro-style RPGs and pixel art graphics. You can get it for free by using Steam or visiting the Time Fantasy website, or you can buy it for a reasonable price and support the creator. Either way, you will have access to a lot of sprites that will enhance your game's battles and visuals. Have fun creating your own RPGs!
