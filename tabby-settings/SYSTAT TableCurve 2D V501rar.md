- The type of equations you want to fit: linear, nonlinear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, etc.
- The number of terms or coefficients you want to use for each equation type.
- The criterion for ranking the fitted equations: R-squared, adjusted R-squared, standard error, F-statistic, etc.
- The number of equations you want to display in the results.
- The level of significance you want to use for testing the coefficients.
- The method of weighting you want to apply to your data.
- The method of optimization you want to use for finding the best-fit parameters.

You can also select from a total of 6 smoothing/denoising algorithms to remove the noise in your data[^1^]. Of special importance is the Eigendecomposition Denoising, a non-parametric procedure where separation is based on signal strength[^1^].
 
## Step 3: Start Fitting
 
The final step is to start fitting your data. You can do this by clicking on the Fit menu and selecting Start Fitting. TableCurve 2D will automatically fit thousands of equations to your data and rank them according to your chosen criterion. You can view the results in the Report window or the Summary window.
 
In the Report window, you can see the details of each fitted equation, such as:

- The equation form and the fitted parameters.
- The goodness-of-fit statistics and the confidence intervals.
- The analysis of variance (ANOVA) table and the coefficient tests.
- The residuals and the residual plots.
- The predicted values and the prediction plots.

In the Summary window, you can see a comparison of the top-ranked equations in a table format. You can sort, filter, or export the table as needed. You can also plot any of the fitted equations in the Graph window and compare them with your data.
 
## Conclusion
 
TableCurve 2D is a user-friendly and versatile software tool that can help you perform curve-fitting and data modeling with ease and accuracy. It can handle any type of data and any type of equation with its state-of-the-art fitting algorithms. It can also provide you with comprehensive reports and graphs that can enhance your understanding and presentation of your data.
