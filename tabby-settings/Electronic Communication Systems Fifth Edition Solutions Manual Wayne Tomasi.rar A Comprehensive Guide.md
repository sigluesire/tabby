# Electronic Communication Systems: A Comprehensive Guide by Wayne Tomasi
 
Electronic communication systems are devices and systems that transmit and receive information using electromagnetic signals. They are used for various purposes, such as telephony, radio, television, data transmission, satellite communication, and wireless networking. Electronic communication systems can be classified into analog and digital systems, depending on the type of modulation and demodulation techniques used to encode and decode the information.

**Chapter 5: Digital Modulation**
 
Digital modulation is the process of converting digital data into analog signals that can be transmitted over a communication channel. Digital modulation techniques can be classified into two main categories: amplitude shift keying (ASK), and angle shift keying (ASK). ASK techniques vary the amplitude of a carrier signal according to the digital data, while ASK techniques vary the phase or frequency of a carrier signal according to the digital data. Some of the common ASK techniques are on-off keying (OOK), amplitude modulation (AM), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Some of the common ASK techniques are binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), frequency shift keying (FSK), and minimum shift keying (MSK).
 
The advantages of digital modulation over analog modulation are higher noise immunity, higher spectral efficiency, higher data rate, and easier implementation. However, digital modulation also has some disadvantages, such as higher bandwidth requirement, higher power consumption, and higher complexity. The choice of a suitable digital modulation technique depends on various factors, such as the channel characteristics, the data rate, the bit error rate, the power efficiency, and the cost.
 
The book explains the principles and applications of various digital modulation techniques in detail. It also discusses the performance analysis of digital modulation systems in terms of bit error rate, signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth efficiency, and power efficiency. The book also introduces some advanced topics in digital modulation, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), spread spectrum modulation, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
