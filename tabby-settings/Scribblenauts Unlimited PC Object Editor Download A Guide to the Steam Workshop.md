# How to Download and Use the Object Editor in Scribblenauts Unlimited for PC
 
Scribblenauts Unlimited is a game that lets you create anything you can imagine and use it to solve puzzles. But what if you want to create something that doesn't exist in the game? That's where the Object Editor comes in. The Object Editor is a feature that allows you to customize existing objects or create new ones from scratch. You can change their appearance, behavior, properties, and even sounds. You can then share your creations with other players online or use them in your own game.
