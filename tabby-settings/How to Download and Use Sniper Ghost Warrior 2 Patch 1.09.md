You will encounter different enemies, such as rebels, mercenaries, snipers, and even tanks. You will also have to use different weapons, such as sniper rifles, pistols, knives, and explosives. Some missions will require you to work with a spotter or a team, while others will let you operate solo.
  
## What are the main features of Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2?

## Is Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 worth playing?
