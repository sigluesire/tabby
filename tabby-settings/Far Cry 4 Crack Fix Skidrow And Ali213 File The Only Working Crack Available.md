Far Cry 4 is one of the most popular and immersive open-world games of 2014, but it also has some technical issues that prevent some players from enjoying it fully. One of the most common problems is the game crashing or not launching with certain cracks, such as Skidrow and Ali213. In this article, we will show you how to fix these issues and play Far Cry 4 without any hassle.
 
## What are Skidrow and Ali213 Cracks?
 
Skidrow and Ali213 are two groups of hackers who release cracked versions of games that bypass the DRM (digital rights management) protection and allow players to play them without buying them. However, these cracks are not always perfect and may cause some errors or glitches in the game. For example, some players reported that Far Cry 4 crashes on startup or freezes during gameplay with Skidrow or Ali213 cracks.

## How to Fix Far Cry 4 Crashes and Errors with Skidrow and Ali213 Cracks?
 
There are several possible solutions to fix Far Cry 4 crashes and errors with Skidrow and Ali213 cracks. Here are some of them:
 
- Update your game to the latest version. Some cracks may not work with older versions of the game, so make sure you have the latest patch installed. You can download it from the official website or from other sources online.
- Update your drivers. Sometimes, outdated or incompatible drivers can cause crashes or performance issues in games. Make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card, sound card, and other devices. You can use a driver updater tool or visit the manufacturer's website to download them.
- Disable antivirus and firewall. Some antivirus or firewall programs may interfere with the game or the crack and prevent them from running properly. Try disabling them temporarily before launching the game and see if that helps. Remember to enable them again after playing.
- Copy the missing file. Some players reported that they fixed the game crashing by copying a missing file called GFSDK\_SSAO.win64.dll from the folder of the v1.6 crack of ALI213[^3^]. Only copy this file and paste it into the installed game directory where it is needed. Do not copy any other files from the crack.
- Use a different crack. If none of the above solutions work for you, you may want to try a different crack that is more compatible with your game version and system. There are many cracks available online, such as Reloaded, FTS, 3DM, etc. However, be careful when downloading them as some may contain viruses or malware.

## Conclusion
 
Far Cry 4 is a great game that deserves to be played without any crashes or errors. If you are using Skidrow or Ali213 cracks and encounter these problems, you can try the solutions we mentioned above and see if they work for you. Alternatively, you can buy the original game from a trusted source and support the developers.
  
## How to Play Far Cry 4 Like a Pro?
 
Far Cry 4 is not only a game of shooting and stealth, but also of exploration and survival. You will need to master various skills and strategies to overcome the challenges and enemies in the vast and diverse world of Kyrat. Here are some tips and tricks to help you play Far Cry 4 like a pro:

- Upgrade your Loot Bag first. One of the first things you should do in Far Cry 4 is to upgrade your Loot Bag, which allows you to carry more items and loot. You will need animal skins to craft bigger bags, so hunt down some wild animals and collect their pelts. A bigger Loot Bag will let you loot more weapons, ammo, money, and other useful items from enemies and chests.
- Elephants are better than cars. If you see an elephant in Far Cry 4, don't be afraid to hop on its back and ride it. Elephants are faster, stronger, and more durable than cars, and they can also attack enemies with their trunks or stomp them to death. You can even use your weapons while riding an elephant, making it a deadly mobile platform.
- Animals can be useful. Besides elephants, there are many other animals in Far Cry 4 that can be useful to you. For example, you can use bait to lure predators like tigers or bears to attack your enemies, or use animal skins to craft new items or trade them for money. You can also tame some animals with the Beast Master skill and use them as companions in combat.
- Your choices will have consequences. Far Cry 4 has a branching storyline that depends on your choices and actions. You will have to make decisions that will affect the fate of Kyrat and its people, such as choosing between Amita or Sabal as your leader, or whether to spare or kill certain characters. Think carefully before you make a choice, as it may have unforeseen consequences later.
- The Microlight Chopper is your best friend. One of the best ways to travel and explore Kyrat is by using the Microlight Chopper, a small helicopter that you can find at some outposts or call in with a token. The Microlight Chopper is fast, agile, and easy to control, and it can also be equipped with a machine gun or rockets for some aerial combat. You can use it to scout enemy locations, reach high places, or just enjoy the scenery.

## Conclusion
 
Far Cry 4 is a game that offers a lot of freedom and fun for players who want to experience an epic adventure in a beautiful and dangerous land. By following these tips and tricks, you can make the most out of your journey and become a legend in Kyrat.
