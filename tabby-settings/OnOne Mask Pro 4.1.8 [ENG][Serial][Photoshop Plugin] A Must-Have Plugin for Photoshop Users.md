## How to Use OnOne Mask Pro 4.1.8 in Photoshop
 
To use OnOne Mask Pro 4.1.8 in Photoshop, you need to have the plugin installed on your computer and activated with a serial key. You can download the plugin from the official website[^2^] and follow the instructions to install and activate it.
 
Once you have the plugin ready, you can follow these steps to mask an image in Photoshop:
 
1. Open your image in Photoshop and make a copy of the background layer by pressing Ctrl+J (Windows) or Command+J (Mac).
2. Select the copied layer and go to Filter > onOne > Mask Pro 4.1.8 to launch the plugin.
3. In the Mask Pro window, you will see a toolbar on the left with various masking tools, such as the Magic Brush, the Pen Tool, the Chisel Tool, and more. You can use these tools to create a mask that separates your foreground subject from the background.
4. The Magic Brush is one of the most useful tools in Mask Pro 4.1.8. It allows you to paint away the colors that you don't want in your image while keeping the transparency of your subject. To use it, select it from the toolbar and choose a color from the Color Palette on the right. Then, paint over the background area that you want to remove.
5. You can also use other tools like the Pen Tool or the Lasso Tool to draw a selection around your subject and then fill it with white using the Fill Tool. This will create a solid mask that covers your subject.
6. As you work on your mask, you can preview it in real-time by choosing different views from the View Mode menu on the top right corner of the window. You can see your image on a solid color background, against the underlying layer, or as a grayscale mask.
7. If you notice any edge halos or color contamination in your mask, you can enable the Color Decontamination option on the bottom right corner of the window. This will remove any background colors from the edges of your subject and make them semi-transparent.
8. You can also use tools like the Chisel Tool or the Blur Tool to refine your mask edges and make them smoother and more natural-looking.
9. When you are happy with your mask, click OK to apply it and return to Photoshop.
10. You can now place your masked image on a new background layer or adjust its color and contrast using adjustment layers.
