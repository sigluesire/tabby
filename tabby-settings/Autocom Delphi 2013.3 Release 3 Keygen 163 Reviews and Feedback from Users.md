In this article, we will show you how to install and activate Autocom Delphi 2013.3 Release 3 using a keygen and a patch.
 
## Step 1: Download the software package
 
You can download the software package from [this link](https://mhhauto.com/Thread-AutoCom-Delphi-2013-3-All-in-One-Installer-for-Cars-Trucks-Activation-VMware). It contains the original installer, the patch, the keygen, and the installation instructions.

## Step 2: Run the installer
 
After downloading the file, extract it using WinRAR or any other program that can handle .rar files. You will see a folder named "Delphi 2013.3 All-in-One Installer". Open it and run the file "Delphi\_2013\_3\_AIO\_Installer.exe". This will launch a batch file that will guide you through the installation process.
 
First, you will be asked to choose between Cars or Trucks software. You can install both if you want, but it will take more time and space. Then, you will be asked to choose the installation directory. The default location is C:\Program Files\Delphi Diagnostics\DS150E (New VCI) for Cars or C:\Program Files\Delphi Diagnostics\DS150E (Heavy Duty) for Trucks. You can change it if you want, but make sure you remember it for later steps.
 
The installer will then copy the files to your chosen directory and create shortcuts on your desktop and start menu. After that, it will ask you to restart your computer. Do not restart yet, as you need to apply the patch first.
 
## Step 3: Apply the patch
 
In the same folder where you ran the installer, you will see another file named "Delphi\_2013\_3\_Patch.exe". Run it as administrator and follow the instructions on the screen. It will ask you to select the software you installed (Cars or Trucks) and then locate the main executable file in your installation directory. For Cars, it is C:\Program Files\Delphi Diagnostics\DS150E (New VCI)\Main.exe. For Trucks, it is C:\Program Files\Delphi Diagnostics\DS150E (Heavy Duty)\Main.exe.
 
The patch will then modify the executable file and create a backup copy in case something goes wrong. It will also create a file named "FileActivation.xml" in your installation directory. This file contains your hardware ID and serial number that you need to activate the software.

## Step 4: Generate the activation file
 
In the same folder where you ran the patch, you will see another file named "Autocom\_Delphi\_KeyGen\_2013\_3.exe". Run it as administrator and click on "Start". It will ask you to open the "FileActivation.xml" file that was created by the patch. Locate it in your installation directory and open it.
 
The keygen will then generate an activation file based on your hardware ID and serial number. It will also save it as "FileActivation.xml" in your installation directory, overwriting the original one. You can also save it to another location if you want.
 
## Step 5: Activate the software
 
Now you can restart your computer and run the software from your desktop or start menu shortcut. It will ask you to activate it online or manually. Choose manual activation and click on "Yes". It will then ask you to open the activation file that was generated by the keygen. Locate it in your installation directory or wherever you saved it and open it.
 
The software will then verify the activation file and
