## What is A Raven Monologue?
  
A Raven Monologue is not your typical game. It has no dialogue, no choices, no puzzles, and no gameplay mechanics. It is more like an interactive animated story book that you can flip through by clicking a single button. The game lasts for about five minutes, and it is designed to be experienced in one sitting.
  
The game features hand-drawn art by Brigitta Rena, the creator of When The Past Was Around and She and The Light Bearer. The art style is whimsical and colorful, creating a contrast with the dark and lonely theme of the story. The game also has a soothing soundtrack by Christabel Annora, which adds to the emotional atmosphere of the game.
  
The story of A Raven Monologue is open to interpretation. You can make your own meaning out of the scenes and characters that you encounter. Some people might see it as a metaphor for social isolation, others might see it as a commentary on communication and acceptance. The game invites you to reflect on your own feelings and thoughts as you follow the raven's journey.
